# Code of Conduct

This project is maintained in my spare time. Please be aware that I may not always have the
availability to review issues or pull requests quickly. Response times can vary.

## Issues

If you open an issue, please include:
- A clear description of the problem
- A minimal and complete testcase or reproduction
- The exact LVGL version, compiler, and platform you used

Issues without a reproducible testcase may be closed without investigation.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome, but they must:
- Be focused and easy to review
- Include a clear explanation of the change
- Avoid unnecessary refactoring or formatting changes

I may not be able to review PRs immediately.

## General Conduct

Please keep communication respectful and constructive. This project is intended to help the
community, and contributions are appreciated.
